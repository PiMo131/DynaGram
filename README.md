# DynaGram
A dynamic diagram creator that can be run as a local website. Can be used to create tree diagrams
Can be used to integrate in websites or node.js applications do dynamically create flowcharts / hierarchy diagrams

**For us as a tool:**

Run locally (explanation below) or go to this link: https://rawcdn.githack.com/PiMo131/DynaGram/6fd8ea99298a0b8578970bb93a6a0515240906a2/index.html 

you can format a textfile in the following way:
You start with the name of the first node (root)
Then all the following nodes will be made with '-'
The next layer is defined by "--"
Et cetera

If you make more then one root, you will get two diagrams. The lay-out will be strange so it is not advisable

Theh homepage will look like this:

After uploading a file or typing something in the text box, the end-result should be something like this:
